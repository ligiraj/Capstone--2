# Medical cost Prediction

## Problem Statement

How would you predict the Medical cost with given variables?

## Objectives

1. Find out the predictor variables of medical cost.
2. Predict medical costs.

## Tools used

Python

Tableau
## Does medical cost depend on the age of a person?

Medical cost increases when age increases.

-The median medical cost of 18 years is $2,198.19. It increases to $6,210.08 when the age is 33 years.

-The trend line below shows p-value <0.0001. It means there is a positive relation between age and medical cost.

## Does medical cost depend on the BMI of a person?

BMI has no impact on medical costs.

- The medical cost is $2,775.19 when BMI is 17.385, and the medical cost is $2,438.06 when BMI is 50.38.this means the medical cost is not increased when BMI is increased.

## Are medical costs different in different regions of the United States?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d93420d4-9aea-40ef-a12f-3dd3d39e5193)

-The southeast region has medical cost distribution more than other regions.

-The Northeast region has a median medical cost is $10,058.

-The Northwest has medical medical costs is $8,966.

-The southeast region has a median medical cost is $9,294.

-The Southwest region has a median medical cost is $8,799.

## Is there any difference in medical cost between gender and habit?

-It is clear that female and male smokers have more medical costs than non-smokers.

-The median medical cost of a female non-smoker is $7,639, it increases to $28,950 when the female is a smoker.

-The median medical cost of a male non-smoker is $6,986 and it increases to $36,085 when the male is a smoker.

## Do smokers have to pay more medical costs than nonsmokers in different regions of the USA?

-In every region, smoker medical costs are relatively higher than nonsmoker medical costs.

-The median medical cost for nonsmokers in the Northeast region starts at $1,712, while the median medical cost for smokers starts at $12,829.

-The median medical cost for nonsmokers in the Northwest region starts at $1,646, while the median medical cost for smokers starts at $14,712.

-The median medical cost for nonsmokers in the Southeast region starts at $1,163, while the median medical cost for smokers starts at $16,578.

-The median medical cost for nonsmokers in the Southwest region starts at $1,254, while the median medical cost for smokers starts at $13,845.

-This means that the medical costs in all regions are higher for smokers than for nonsmokers.

## Do you have to pay more medical charges if you are a smoker and have more children?

-When the number of children increases, the medical cost does not increase for smokers and nonsmokers. However the medical cost increases for smokers with a different number of children compared to nonsmokers.

-The median medical cost for a nonsmoker with no children starts at $1,122, but for a smoker with no children, the median cost starts at $13,748.

-The median medical cost for a nonsmoker with one child starts at $1,711, but for a smoker with no children, the median cost starts at $15,359.

-The median medical cost for a nonsmoker with two children starts at $2,304, but for a smoker with no children, the median cost starts at $12,829.

-The median medical cost for a nonsmoker with three children starts at $3,591, but for a smoker with no children, the median cost starts at $16,420.

-The median medical cost for a nonsmoker with four children starts at $4,505, but for a smoker with no children, the median cost starts at $17,942.

-The median medical cost for a nonsmoker with five children starts at $4,688, but for a smoker with no children, the median cost starts at $19,023.

## Correlation and Conclusion

# Correlation

-The correlation between smoking and medical costs is 0.787251.

The correlation between medical cost and age is 0.299008.

This means that smoking and age may be predictors of medical costs.

# Conclusion

-Medical cost and Predicted medical cost have a positive correlation.

-When the median medical cost is $13,224, the predicted median cost is $13,276.

-This means age and smoker are predictors of medical costs.
